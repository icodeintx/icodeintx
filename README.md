- 👋 Hi, I’m @icodeintx (also known as Scott).  I live in Central Texas, USA and have been a developer for 25+ years.  I am a corporate developer (day job).  Most of my development background is in Microsoft .Net (and prior to .Net).  Additionally I enjoy learning new ways and new technologies.  

- 😎 I'm into Forex currency trading and writing software to help with automated trading (hobby).  Maybe I'll put it on here as open source if it ever gets to that point.

- 👀 I work all day at a corporate job so what is on here is for learning and fun.  

- 💞️ I’m always looking to meet new people and collaborate on technology.
